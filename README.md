# TypeScript--Tutorial2021

-   JavaScript uses " dynamic types (resolved at runtime), TypeScript uses "static types" (set during development). 

# Core types
Array - Any Javascript object, more specific types (type of object) are possible <br />
Tuple - Any Javascript Array, type can be flexible or strict (regarding the element types) <br />
Enum -  Added by TypeScript: Automatically enumerated global constant identifiers <br />
Any -   Any kind of value, no specific type assignment <br />
Unknown - it is better strict and better to use compare to "Any" <br />

# Function 
Void -  if there is no return in a function use Void

# Watch Mode
-   npx tsc "Files Name" -w
